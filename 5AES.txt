üîê Introduction to AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):
AES is a symmetric key encryption standard, widely used to secure data. It operates on fixed block size of 128 bits (16 bytes) and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. AES performs a series of transformations (like SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey) over multiple rounds (10, 12, or 14 depending on key size).

üß† Algorithm (AES-128 Example):
Encryption:
Input plaintext message and secret key.

Convert message to bytes and pad it to 16-byte blocks.

Generate AES cipher using the key and selected mode (e.g., ECB, CBC).

Encrypt the padded plaintext using the cipher.

Output the encrypted message (ciphertext).

Decryption:
Input the ciphertext and the same secret key.

Initialize the AES cipher with the same key and mode.

Decrypt the ciphertext using the cipher.

Unpad the decrypted bytes to retrieve original message.

Output the decrypted message (plaintext).

üßæ Example:
Message: "Good Morning ALL"
Key: Random 128-bit key
Mode: ECB (Electronic Codebook)
